## introduction

In this Session you will find information and resources about the history, motivations and international squatting practices. 

Squatting is the action of occupying an empty building for housing and other political activities. We can say that there is a constant contest for people to find ways to live by themselves or with others in affordable and decent homes and therefore squatting is a manifestation of the housing movement. Although the squatting of land and housing in the UK goes back centuries, it was only in the twentieth century that the modern squatters movement came ot its own. After WWII a wave of squatting began first in army camps and then in empty expensive properties.

We propose "Squatting is a part of the housing movement- Practical squatting histories 1969-2019" as a great resource for the history of organised squatting in UK. This pamphlet contextualises the squatting archival collection at MayDay Rooms. This text is important for developing the argument that all types of squatting, including squatting for housing, are political.
